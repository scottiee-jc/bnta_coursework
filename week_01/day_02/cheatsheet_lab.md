# Lab: create a cheatsheet for Terminal Commands

Do some research to discover what you can do in the Terminal. 

Make a list of commands that you might find useful during the course, with a note of what they do. There is no need to go overboard, just 15 or so commands you think you will find useful. You can use the commands already discussed in class.

Open Terminal and navigate to your `bnta/coursework/week_01/day_2` folder.

Create a new folder: `mkdir terminal_commands`.

Create a Markdown file to record your research:
`touch terminal_cheatsheat.md`.

Note the `.md` file extension, which denotes this as a Markdown file.

Open VSCode (or any text editor) and, using Markdown, create a Terminal commands cheatsheet. There are many resources on the web to help you get to know Markdown. Here is a Markdown cheatsheet to get you started: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Using Git in Terminal

Return to Terminal. We are going to initialise your folder as a Git project (remember, Git is local (i.e. on your laptop), GitHub is remote (popularly known as 'the Cloud')).

Ensure you have navigated to your `terminal_commands` folder.

Type `git init` in order to create a `.git` folder (the `.` indicates it is a hidden file). You should now see `git:(main)` after your folder name. Try typing `ls -a` and you should now see `.git` listed.

### Tracking changes in our code
We can now stage our work and make a commit.

`git add .` will add all changes (in this case everything, as the whole project is new) to be tracked in our `.git` file.

`git commit -m"first commit"` confirms to Git that we want to save this work at this stage.

## GitHub

We are almost ready to push our project to GitHub.

First we need to create a remote repository - a place for your code to sit in GitHub.

Go to your browser and navigate to GitHub

Create a new repository. 

Please remember that this repo must be public in order for the trainers to see it! 

Copy the three lines of code from the middle block that looks like this:

```
...or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_github_name>/<your_repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Terminal

We can now push our code to GitHub. 

Paste the code you copied into the terminal and hit `enter`. 

This code tells Git where to push your work to on GitHub, and then pushes it up.

Check if it worked! Head back to your browser and GitHub, refresh the page and you should now see your file on GitHub.

Copy the URL of your repo in GitHub and paste it into the lab submission form. The link for the lab submission form is bookmarked at the top of your classroom Slack channel.
